## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

I built a verision of this classic game that features JavaScript OOP. Users can play, play again, reset, etc.

## Optimizations
Future enhancements for this app will include some silly animations that display when a player wins. Also perhaps players can enter their names and a running score will be displayed.

## Lessons Learned
Coding OOP with JavaScript.
